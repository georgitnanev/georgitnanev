    // Java Code Conventions by Oracle.

    // Firstly, Code Conventions may be JAVA STANDARDS.

    // Second of all, there are several reasons why have Code Conventions:

    // a) 80 % of the lifetime cost of a piece of software goes to maintenance.
    // b) Very often, software is not maintained by the original author.
    // c) In addition, Code Conventions improve the readability of the software and
    // therefore allow engineers to understand new code more quickly and thoroughly.
    // d) Last but not least, if try to sell your product(code), you need to make sure
    // it is immaculate as you would buy it.

    // In conclusion, I personally think Code Conventions are good.
