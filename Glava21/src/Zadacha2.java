    // For example, in the previous chapter I did make several mistakes such as:
    // 1) Unnecessary empty spaces. Every line counts !!
    // 2) Chosen unclear names for variables such as s1,s2, o1,o2. Avoid that and
    // make it clear by choosing more appropriate - studentOne, objectOne etc.
    // 3) var usage - do not use "var" anymore.
    // 4) Unclear "foreach" - Stick to typical examples, e.g. (Animal animal : animals)
    // 5) enum - All capital letters - EUROPE, ASIA etc.
    // 6) Do not use the enhanced switch-case. Must use switch-case with "break"
